# Show commits that contains the code, then you can: git show <commit_sha>
git log -S "whatever you want to search for"

# An even easier way to show matches right there on the spot
git log -S "your search term" -p

# Same as above, except applied to all branches instead of the checked out branch
git log -S "something" -p --all

# Limit your search to only specific files in a specific directory
git log -S "something specific" -p -- **/models/user*.py

# Search for a regex instead of a string (note the -G instead of -S)
git log -G '^alias \w+=".*"$' -p

---

# Show the commit message that contains your search term, you can supply either
# a string or regular expression with the same flag
git log --grep "your search term"

# Same as above, except applied to all branches instead of the checked out branch
git log --grep "something else" --all
