# https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30590083/how-do-i-rename-both-a-git-local-and-remote-branch-name

# Rename the local branch to the new name
git branch -m <old_name> <new_name>

# Delete the old branch on remote - where <remote> is, for example, origin
git push origin --delete <old_name>

# Prevent git from using the old name when pushing in the next step.
# Otherwise, git will use the old upstream name instead of <new_name>.
git branch --unset-upstream <new_name>

# Push the new branch to remote
git push origin <new_name>
