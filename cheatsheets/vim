# Motions
hjkl - move
w - move forward a word
b - move backward a word

Question: How do I enable relative line numbers?

# Visual mode
v - enter visual mode
shift v - enter visual line mode

y - copy
p - paste

Note: deleted text ends up in paste bucket thing.

u - undo
ctrl r - redo

Actions can be augmented with numbers, i.e.
- w3 - move 3 words forward
- d3w - delete 3 words
- k10 - move 10 lines up
- y5d - yank (copy) five lines down
